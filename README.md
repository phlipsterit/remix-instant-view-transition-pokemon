# Welcome to pokemon view transitions with instant client side navigation

This repository is forked from https://github.com/AlemTuzlak/remix-view-transition-pokemon/compare/main...phlipsterit:remix-instant-view-transition-pokemon:main

It adds instant client side navigation by feeding the client loader of the next route with data from the previous route
Then more data is loaded after the navigation if needed with a useFetcher.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```
